# Selenium Test Automation Framework

This project provides scalable and easy to maintain selenium test framework. It is written in Java and follows best practices as well as most recent and top rated tools. Test architecture is based on page object pattern, multi-platform usage implemented through factory classes.

Framework supports:

- Logging to file
- Detailed Allure reporting with attached screenshots and log file
- Multi-platform run (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Local and Remote drivers. Driver management (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) of the drivers required by Selenium WebDriver (e.g., chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver, etc.) in a fully automated manner.
- Data driven approach for some cases, with parametrised test scripts (URL as an example for demo)
- Soft assertions in test scripts
